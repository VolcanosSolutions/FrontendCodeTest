# FrontendCodeTest

1. As we mentioned, here is a quick coding challenge. It's important to note that it's by no means a test...we just want to get a sense for how you write code and solve problems.
We have a simple API that returns a JSON array. We would like you to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to read the API and display it in an organized way. In addition, you should add in some sort of sorting mechanic to the front-end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

You must display the name, image and ABV percentage, the rest is completely up to you.

2. If you wish to apply for a more design focused role, Use the logo provided and redraw it in vector format, and animate the volcano part. If you can redesign it and provide multiple alternate looks that is also fine.
2.2 Create a Favicon for the website inspired from the logo or general theme.
